The expression printed circuits does not cover circuits combined with elements other than those obtained in the printing process, nor discrete resistors, capacitors, or inductors.

However, printed circuits may be fitted with non-printed connection elements.

12.- In the sense of $n^{\circ}$ s 85.41 and 85.42, the following are regarded as:
a) $1^{\circ}$) semiconductor devices, devices that operate based on the change in resistivity under the influence of an electric field or semiconductor transducers.
Semiconductor devices may also include an assembly of several elements, even equipped with active or passive devices whose function is auxiliary.
For the purpose of this definition, semiconductor transducers are semiconductor sensors, semiconductor actuators, semiconductor resonators, and semiconductor oscillators, which are types of discrete semiconductor devices that serve an intrinsic function, which can convert any type of physical or chemical phenomenon or action into an electrical signal or convert an electrical signal into any type of physical phenomenon or action.
All the elements comprising a transducer are joined in such a way that they cannot be separated and may also include inseparable materials necessary for the construction or operation of a semiconductor device.
For the purpose of this definition:

1) The term semiconductor means built or manufactured on a semiconductor substrate or made from semiconductor-based materials, produced using semiconductor technology, in which the substrate or semiconductor materials play a critical and irreplaceable role in the function and performance of the transducer and whose operation is based on semiconductor, physical, electrical, chemical, and optical properties.
2) Physical or chemical phenomena relate to phenomena such as pressure, sound waves, acceleration, vibration, motion, orientation, stress, magnetic field intensity, electric field intensity, light, radioactivity, humidity, creep, concentration of chemical products, etc.
3) Semiconductor sensors are a type of semiconductor device consisting of microelectronic or mechanical structures created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor and whose function is to detect physical or chemical quantities and convert them into electrical signals produced by the resulting variations in electrical properties or a deformation of the mechanical structure.
4) Semiconductor actuators are a type of semiconductor device consisting of microelectronic and mechanical structures created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor and whose function is to convert electrical signals into physical motion.
5) Semiconductor resonators are a type of semiconductor device consisting of microelectronic and mechanical structures created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor and whose function is to generate a mechanical or electrical oscillation of a predefined frequency that depends on the physical geometry of these structures in response to an external electrical signal.

$2^{\circ}$) Light-emitting diodes (LED) are semiconductor devices made from semiconductor materials that convert electrical energy into visible, infrared, or ultraviolet radiations, even electrically connected to each other and possibly combined with protection diodes. The light-emitting diodes (LED) in $n^{\circ} 85.41$ do not contain elements intended to provide power or control power;
b) Integrated circuits:
$1^{\circ}$) monolithic integrated circuits in which circuit elements (diodes, transistors, resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.) are created in the mass (essentially) and on the surface of a semiconductor material (for example, doped silicon, gallium arsenide, silicon-germanium, indium phosphide), forming an indivisible whole;
$2^{\circ}$) hybrid integrated circuits that consist almost inseparably, through interconnections or bonding wires, on the same insulating substrate (glass, ceramic, etc.) of passive elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.) obtained through thin or thick film circuit technology and active elements (diodes, transistors, monolithic integrated circuits, etc.) obtained through semiconductor technology. These circuits may also include discrete components;
$3^{\circ}$) multi-chip integrated circuits consisting of two or more interconnected monolithic integrated circuits, combined in a practically inseparable manner, resting or not on one or more insulating substrates and may or may not have pins, but without other active or passive circuit elements.
$4^{\circ}$) multi-component integrated circuits that are combinations of one or more monolithic, hybrid, or multi-chip circuits and that include at least one of the following components: sensors, actuators, oscillators, silicon resonators, even combined together, or components providing the functions of items potentially falling under $n^{\circ}$ s $85.32,85.33,85.41$, or inductors potentially falling under $n^{\circ} 85.04$, and which are combined in such a way that they become practically inseparable in a single body like an integrated circuit, to form a component like those used to be assembled on a printed circuit board or another support, by connecting pins, wires, connectors, pads, bumps, or discs.
For the purposes of this definition:

1. Components may be discrete, manufactured independently of one another, and then assembled into a multi-component integrated circuit or integrated into other components.
1. The expression "on silicon" means that the component is built on a silicon substrate or is made from silicon-based materials or is made on an integrated circuit chip.
3. a) Silicon sensors are made up of microelectronic or mechanical structures created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor, whose function is to detect physical or chemical phenomena and convert them into electrical signals when variations in electrical properties or mechanical structure deformation occur. Physical or chemical phenomena relate to phenomena such as pressure, sound waves, acceleration, vibration, motion, orientation, stress, magnetic field intensity, electric field intensity, light, radioactivity, humidity, creep, concentration of chemical products, etc.
b) Silicon actuators consist of microelectronic and mechanical structures created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor, whose function is to convert electrical signals into physical motion.
c) Silicon resonators are components consisting of microelectronic or mechanical structures created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor, whose function is to generate a mechanical or electrical oscillation of a predefined frequency that depends on the physical geometry of these structures in response to an external signal.
d) Silicon oscillators are active components made up of microelectronic or mechanical structures created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor, whose function is to generate a mechanical or electrical oscillation of a predefined frequency that depends on the physical geometry of these structures.
For the purposes of classifying items defined in this note, $n^{\circ}$ s 85.41 and 85.42 take precedence over any other position in the nomenclature, except for $n^{\circ} 85.23$ which may cover them due to their function."
